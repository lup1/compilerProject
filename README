scanner.flex contains the tokens that are detected by the scanner
parser.bison contains the sequences of tokens that should be allowed as the syntax of the program. Additionally, although not yet implemented, it should aid in the creation of an
abstract syntax tree that will eventually help with generating machine code.

NOTE: .h files not edited to work for parser!!!
